        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I'm currently a student at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wisc.edu/">UW-Madison</a>, majoring in <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu/">Computer Science</a>.
            At the moment, I'm looking into a double major with Political Science.</p>
        <h3>Jobs</h3>
        <p>I currently work as a Help Desk Technical Writer for the UW-Madison Division of Information of
            Technology(DoIT).
            In addition to addressing and resolving technology incidents across campus,
            I create and update documentation that other Help Desk agents and departments use across campus.</p>
        <p>Outside of business hours, I also give piano lessons to other students on campus. I specialize in music
            theory and comtemporary songs,
            but I also enjoy a few classic songs here and there.
        </p>
        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p>As of July 2019, I am the current COO of Intraburst, an enterprise-level software company specializing in
            information technology management.
            Our software, Burst, is currently under development and is set to be released in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>On the music side of things, I compose and arrange songs whenever I get some free time. Feel free to check out my works on the <a href="music.html">Music page</a>.</p>
